Instructions to run uit tests:

    - All tests are defined in files as such: tests-{script_name}.sh, where {script_name}.sh is the file we are testing.
    - To run the tests we use the auxiliary script `unit-tests.sh`, which creates a clean docker environment on which to run the tests.
    - Docker must be installed and running in the system and the user must have access.
    - The docker image is kept, it isn't destroyed when the script finishes. If something in the Dockerfile is changed, run with `-r` to rebuild

TIPS:
    - When many tests are broken after a merge a good way to test them and
    fix them in order bypassing the desorder in which they are run is to use
    the fact that a bash script exits on an unknown character. Write a `Ç`
    after the first test and run it, only the first one will be run. Whenever
    a test is ready, you move the `Ç` character a test or some tests down.
    That way, you don't have to scroll through 70 tests to find one and see if
    it is fixed.
