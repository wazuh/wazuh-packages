Wazuh RPM packages for IBM AIX
==============================

In this repository, you can find the necessary tools to build a Wazuh package for AIX.

## Building RPM packages

To build an AIX package, you need to download this repository and use the `generate_wazuh_packages.sh` script. This script will download the source code from the [wazuh/wazuh](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh) repository, and generate the `.ppc.rpm` package. In addition, you can install the build dependencies with this script.

1. Download this repository and go to the rpm directory:
    ```bash
    $ curl -L https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-packages/tarball/master | tar zx
    $ cd wazuh-wazuh-packages-*
    $ cd aix
    ```

2. Execute the `generate_rpm_package.sh` script to build the package. There are multiple parameters to select which package is going to be built, its architecture, etc. Here you can see all the different parameters:
    ```shellsession
    # ./generate_package.sh -h

    Usage: ./generate_rpm.sh [OPTIONS]

        Usage: $0 [OPTIONS]"

            -e Install all the packages necessaries to build the RPM package"
            -b <branch> Select Git branch. Example v3.5.0"
            -s <rpm_directory> Directory to store the resulting RPM package. By default: /tmp/build"
            -p <rpm_home> Installation path for the package. By default: /var"
            -h Shows this help"
    ```
    * To install all the dependencies necessaries to build the RPM package:

        `# ./generate_package.sh -e`
    * To build a wazuh-agent package for version 3.8.2, revision 3821 and store it in `/tmp`:

        `# ./generate_package.sh -b v3.8.2 -s /tmp -a x86_64 -r 3821`.
    * To install the dependencies, build a wazuh-agent package for version 3.8.2, revision 3821 and store it in `/tmp`:

        `# ./generate_package.sh -b v3.8.2 -s /tmp -a x86_64 -r 3821`.

3. When the execution finishes, you can find your `.ppc.rpm` package in specified folder.
